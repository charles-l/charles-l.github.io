Working in NJ as a scientific computing software developer. Currently working on ML and numerical programming problems.

In my free time I lift (1000 pound club here I come!), run, implement programming languages, do some graphics programming.

I (attempt to) compose music for electric guitar (using GarageBand as my DAW). I play practically every day, but haven't really written anything worth listening to yet. I'm inspired by artists like Plini, Oceill, Mest&#xED;s, Polyphia, and  ichika.
