Working at a fintech company in NYC as a software developer. 
Previously worked in NJ on scientific computing software (ML and numerical programming problems).

In my free time I lift (joined the 1000 pound club recently!), run, and work on various side projects. 

I'm interested in building better tools for software developers, [local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html), reverse engineering, CTFs, Linux, programming language implementation, data visualization, graphics programming, and game development.

When I'm not coding, I (attempt to) compose music for electric guitar (using GarageBand as my DAW). I play practically every day, but haven't really written anything worth listening to yet. I'm inspired by the work of artists like Plini, Oceill, Mest&#xED;s, Polyphia, ichika, and Mick Gordon.
