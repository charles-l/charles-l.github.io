*AHH! BUZZWORD!*

Don't worry. I'm just talking about a super awesome piece of software. Though, I do normally recoil when I hear that word.

The [synergy](https://github.com/synergy/synergy/) I'm talking about is a cross-platform app that allows you to control multiple computers with just one keyboard and mouse over wifi. It's kind of a KVM for multiple devices (but it shares your clipboard across!)

Building it on OS X 10.10 is a little bit of a pain (you'll have to hack around in the python build script, and the CMake config), but once you do, it's a fire-and-forget type of thing that just works. I've been happily using it with OS X and [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Synergy) for a few days now.

On Arch, I've [riced](http://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) my setup pretty hard. I use [lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar), which isn't technically a system tray (you simply pipe content to it when you start X). Synergy will fail to start unless you have a tray, so I just wrote a tiny shell script wrapper to start [trayer](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/i686/trayer/) and synergy:

```bash
killall synergy # in case I already have an instance running
trayer &
synergy &
sleep 1
killall trayer
```

Then move synergy to another desktop or [group](http://blog.z3bra.org/2014/11/avoid-workspaces.html), and proceed upon your merry way.
