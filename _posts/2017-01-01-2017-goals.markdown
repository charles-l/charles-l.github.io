Compilers are neat. This coming year I'm going to try and put special emphasis on compiler design. I'll use Scheme and ML (and possibly a tiny amount of C) to develop my language projects.

My goals are to:

* Release a 1.0 version of [my compiler backend](https://github.com/charles-l/dirt)
* Write a formally verified backend.
* Implement a lisp ([partly done already](https://github.com/charles-l/po) - but I got sidetracked).
* Study for the CCNA over the summer (I really ought to know networking better)
* Do a proper algorithms course ([maybe this one](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms))
* Read more classic CS books :)

I think that'll be enough to keep me busy for a while. If not, I'll throw in some OS dev too ;)
