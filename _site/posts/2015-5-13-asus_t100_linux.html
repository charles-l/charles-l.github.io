<p>Linux support on the Asus T100 is currently pretty bad. It does run, but there are a lot of loopholes you have to jump through to get it to a working state. Unless you’re an experience Linux user, I wouldn’t recommend following this guide.</p>
<p>What’s supported out of the box: - Touchscreen - Keyboard - Hard Disk (with newer versions of the kernel)</p>
<p>What’s supported with a little extra configuration: - WiFi</p>
<p>What’s not supported (more on them later): - Sound - Synaptic trackpad (it does work as a regular mouse, though) - GPIO buttons (other than the hardwired power button) - Backlight - Accelerometer - Battery</p>
<p>The easiest way to boot Linux is to install <a href="www.rodsbooks.com/refind">rEFInd</a> and select your USB on boot. The alternative is fiddling with the Windows EFI settings, but if you plan on dual-booting, it’s easiest to go with rEFInd.</p>
<p>The biggest reason it’s difficult to install Linux on this device is because it uses 32-bit EFI, despite running a 64-bit processor. Unless your distro comes with a 32-bit EFI bootloader, you’ll need to build it and manually put it on your installation media. I used a 32-bit build of GRUB and put it in the <code>/boot/EFI</code> directory of a live Arch Linux USB.</p>
<p>When you select Linux from the rEFInd menu on boot, it’ll drop you into a GRUB recovery shell. From here, you’ll be able to select the USB device to boot:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; linux (hd0)/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz-linux archisolabel=ARCH_052014
&gt; initrd (hd0)/arch/boot/x86_64/initramfs-linux.img
&gt; boot</code></pre>
<p>From here, you can install Linux. Some things to bear in mind when installing:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The main drive is <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>. <code>/dev/sdb</code> is unwritable and contains a readonly recovery version of Windows.</li>
<li>Make sure you install a recent version of the kernel to have the hardware support you need.</li>
<li>If you need wireless, <em>YOU CANNOT RELY ON THE INTERNAL BROADCOM CARD DURING INSTALLATION</em>, you’ll need an external wireless adapter.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve successfully installed Linux, congrats! That’s pretty much all there is to it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strike>The internal Broadcom BRC403241 chip is not well supported. You can get the firmware from the <code>linux-firmware</code> repo, but it doesn’t contain the nvram configuration which means you still can’t see the device. If you want, you can try messing around with <a href="www.github.com/jfwells/linux-asus-t100ta">reverse-engineered nvram files</a>. That’ll make the device appear and available to connect to a WiFi network. However, at it’s best, the connection lasts for only a few MB of data, then disconnects. There’s no solution currently.</strike></p>
<p><strong>EDIT May 15 2015:</strong> If you install the <code>linux-ck</code> from Arch Linux AUR, the wireless is stable enough that it works as the only wireless card. I had a blip when I was using it where it refused to connect, but after rebooting it came back.</p>
<p>The trackpad can move the mouse, but the kernel doesn’t detect it as a synaptic device so it doesn’t support multitouch.</p>
<p>As for the sound, backlight, battery and GPIO buttons, I still have to investigate them more thoroughly to see if they aren’t supported by extra kernel configuration (I’m just going with Arch’s Vanilla Kernel at the moment, which has a surprising amount of kernel support).</p>
<p>Overall, I can use it as a work machine that is nice on the go. In tablet mode, it’s becoming more useful (because of the wireless now works)</p>
