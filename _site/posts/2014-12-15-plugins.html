<p>I did a major overhaul of this blog over the weekend, and since I’ve recently been writing loads of raw HTML and CSS recently, I decided to use some front-end tools to see how they worked.</p>
<h2 id="style-overhaul-with-less">Style overhaul with LESS</h2>
<p>I wrote the style from scratch using less. Since the site is simple – the main CSS file is only 100 lines long – I didn’t use a CSS framework. The result? Less didn’t help that much.</p>
<p>Maybe I simply don’t understand the correct way to use LESS, but the only LESS specific thing I did was create variables for the colors of my color palette. Other than that, it’s plain old CSS.</p>
<h2 id="jekyll-plugins">JEKYLL PLUGINS!?</h2>
<p>EDIT: Welp… GitHub doesn’t like me and doesn’t allow me to use Jekyll plugins, and I can’t build the site locally and just have GitHub host it. :(</p>
<p>I also wrote a script to generate a YAML file with recent projects that Jekyll can then convert into HTML, rather than using JavaScript to create the list dynamically.</p>
<h2 id="coffeescript">CoffeeScript</h2>
<p>I’m definitely going to use Coffescript again, as it managed to make working with JavaScript a little nicer (even though I just used CoffeScript for the Gruntfile). I find JavaScript as a language, pretty crappy. I even find the syntax ugly, even though I like C a lot (the reason being that, even though they share a similar syntax, C has a completely different coding style).</p>
<h2 id="grunt">Grunt</h2>
<p>Grunt is essentially Ruby’s rake and bundler for Node. Since I’m using Jekyll, and have access to all the Ruby gems avalaible, I really didn’t find it that helpful. There are loads of plugins for Grunt, but Ruby has lots of gems that essentially do the same thing. For my blog, I used a Less compiler, CSS minifier, Jekyll plugin and shell plugin (to shell out and run Ruby code. What a hack).</p>
<p>I’ll most likely switch it out with Rake sometime in the future, but for now: meh…</p>
<p>What I’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jekyll is awesome</li>
<li>GitHub doesn’t allow Jekyll plugins :(</li>
<li>Coffeescript is awesome</li>
<li>Grunt is meh, unless you’re a node developer</li>
<li>I don’t get less.</li>
<li>Front end design takes forever.</li>
<li>I’m now going to go write some Go code. o/</li>
</ul>
