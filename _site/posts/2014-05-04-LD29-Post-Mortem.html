<h2 id="what-went-right">What went right</h2>
<p>I managed to get it done! This is my second Ludum Dare submission, and I really cut it close this time, but I managed to release a fairly finished product 30 minutes before the deadline. I had a few issues with my physics library, but I managed to solve most of them before releasing. The only collision issues left were some minor issues with the wall. The game ended up being more fun than I though it would be, even though I didn’t plan ahead at all. I literally had no idea what I wanted to do before, other than wanting to have a ninja fire a bow at something coming out of the ground. I just started writing code and saw what it came out.</p>
<p>Some of the assets came out pretty nice. I really like the ninja, the arrows and the music (which I wrote in about 30 minutes). It’s not great, but I’m still proud of it :P</p>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong</h2>
<p>I didn’t do enough work on the worm asset. It looks really choppy and awkward. If I could do it again, I would just draw an individual section of the worm and have the other sections follow it. I also wanted to add line beneath the worms showing the tunnel the worms dug. I just ran out of time before I could. The balance was a little off. Some people figured out how to spam arrows and sit in the corner. I’ll have to add some safeguard against that.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish I’d added more variation to the gameplay. Maybe another weapon, or mechanic.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-tips-if-i-may-p">A few tips (if I may :P)</h2>
<p>Good physics and collision solving are super important, guys. If the physics don’t work right, it turns me off the game really quickly. If you really want to write a physics engine for your submission, that’s fine, just practice it first. I spent a few days writing a simple AABB collision library, just to see how it works. I still prefer to use an external physics library, though.</p>
<p>Try to limit the scope of the game. Game jams are for getting interesting core gameplay, not for creating an entire game. A single level with fun gameplay is preferable to a multilevel game with stale gameplay. Keep the art simple. Unless you have a dedicated artist (for the jam). I recommend sticking to pixel art, because it’s easy, fast and usually looks pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="stuff-i-used">Stuff I used</h2>
<p>I used <a href="http://pixenapp.com/">Pixen</a> to create all of the pixel art this time. It’s open source, but you also have the option to pay for the binaries. Me, being the cheapskate that I am, built it from source. It’s a good editor, and worth $10 if you don’t want the bother of building it. I’ve used <a href="http://www.pickleeditor.com/">Pickle</a> in previous game jams, but it’s not quite as powerful as Pixen (but it’s a little simpler to use).</p>
<p>I wrote the music in GarageBand really quickly. I’m more of a performer than a composer, so for me, writing music consists of hitting a few notes that sound good together, then adding a second track and playing a harmony. I haven’t really learned music theory :P. To make it sound retro, I added a bitcrusher filter to everything and exported in as low quality as I could.</p>
<p>As always, I wrote the game in <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> and used the <a href="http://love2d.org/">Love2D</a> game engine. I also used the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vrld/HardonCollider/">Hardon Collider</a> for collision detection. Maybe it wasn’t the best idea, to use this, because it didn’t have collision solving built in, and I didn’t know it very well, but it ended up working out OK in the end.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vrld/hump">HUMP</a> gives you a bunch of awesome features including:</li>
<li>Timers</li>
<li>A Camera</li>
<li>Gamestates</li>
<li>A simple vector</li>
<li>Classes (but I prefer middleclass. See below)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kikito/anim8">anim8</a>, an awesome animation library. It really helped out with this game.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kikito/middleclass">MiddleClass</a>. A really awesome class library for Lua. I use it for all my games.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to see a bunch of crappy game jam code, I have <a href="https://github.com/charles-l/LD29">Ninja vs Worms in a GitHub repo</a>. It’s better organized than my last Ludum Dare submission, but has some really hacky collision code that’s mixed in everywhere. Sorry ’bout that :P</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I learned a lot from this jam and I hope you got something out this article.</p>
<p>Happy game jamming :) <br /> - Chuck</p>
